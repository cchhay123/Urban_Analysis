# Urban Analysis Coursework

This repository includes homework assignments from my Urban Analytics course. Through these assignments, I explored how to work with spatial and demographic data to analyze urban patterns, inequality, and public health outcomes.

## Homework 1: Spatial Demographic Analysis

- **Data Retrieval**: Used the `tidycensus` package to pull American Community Survey (ACS) data across census tracts and counties.
- **Data Wrangling**: Cleaned and joined socioeconomic indicators including population, income, race, education, and housing variables.
- **Mapping and Visualization**: Created choropleth maps and scatterplots with `ggplot2` to compare trends across cities.

*Skills Learned*: Working with census APIs, cleaning demographic data, joining spatial datasets, and creating comparative visualizations.

## Homework 2: COVID-19 Case Study

- **Public Health + Urban Data**: Merged COVID-19 case and death data with social vulnerability indexes and healthcare metrics.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Explored statistical relationships between social indicators (like income and race) and COVID-19 outcomes.
- **Geospatial Visualization**: Created maps to identify vulnerable counties and understand spatial trends in pandemic impact.

*Skills Learned*: Data joining, filtering, exploratory correlation analysis, and geospatial storytelling through bivariate mapping.

## Tools & Packages Used

- `tidycensus` – census data retrieval  
- `dplyr`, `tidyr` – data cleaning and wrangling  
- `ggplot2`, `tmap`, `leaflet` – data and spatial visualization  
- `sf` – handling spatial objects in R
